                6.finally once restart your android mobile. Had this issue with the google play music player for a long time. If the uploaded or liked songs are missing from the app, you should check if you are on the right google account.
    </p>

    <h3>N7 player is somewhat uniquely designed and has decent equalizer options, but equalizer produces delay between action (like song switch) and playback.</h3>
    <p>6.finally once restart your android mobile. Does the stock music player work since you&#039;ve moved the music to the ext sd card? Essentially, google play music shouldn&#039;t ever erase music from the microsd card unless you explicitly tell it to. Google play music suffered a nasty bug a couple of weeks back.</p>
