                As the title suggests, i&#039;m having difficulty getting the album art for my music to show up in the google play music app for android. Since last week, opening the app does not show anything, instead i get stuck on a loading music library page. Google play music is a streaming app and music player that features over 35 million songs, which is impressive compared to a lot of other music streaming apps out there.
    </p>

    <h3>Previously whenever i&#039;ve bought music from the google play store, it showed up automatically in the app.</h3>
    <p>I also have a samsung galaxy s7, which works perfectly with both bluetooth devices. Does anybody know why google play music does not show all my downloaded music in songs, however it shows in a large downloaded playlist? Google music seems to have issues with missing files. A paid monthly subscription not only gets you complete access to the entire portfolio, but you can also take advantage of a youtube.</p>
