                I did not like this since i hopped in my car and the music app started playing. In this application, it does playing an audio file streaming. My iphone starts playing music by itself even when i have not opened the apple music app.

    <h3>If you&#039;ve got an iphone 4 or iphone 4s that&#039;s having some issues with sound, you probably aren&#039;t alone.</h3>
    <p>The file seems to load but never actually play. Could it be because of a restriction needing a click event?

I have an iphone 6s, ios 12.1.2 and this problem has popped up very recently.</p>
