    <h3>We&#039;ve known about the transcendent power of solitude for centuries;</h3>
    <p>The space between the first four notes and the second iteration definitely adds dramatic flair and probably increases anxiety. Practice &amp; theory stack exchange is a question and answer site for musicians, students, and enthusiasts. Begins speeding up the element of music defined as the ordered flow of music through time, or more specifically, the particular arrangement of note lengths in a piece. If i had my life to live over again, i would have made a rule to read some poetry and listen to some music 78.</p>

        <p>And just as music is the space between notes, just as the stars are beautiful because of the space between them, just as the sun strikes raindrops at a certain angle and throws a prism of color across the sky—so the space where i exist, and want to keep existing, and to be quite frank i hope i die in.</p>
