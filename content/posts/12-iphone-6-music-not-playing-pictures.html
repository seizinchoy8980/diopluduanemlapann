                I foolishly updated both iphone 6 and ipad mini with the new ios 9.1 on the day of release, and spent all day yesterday trying to make apple music work. One good method is to insure that your iphone is not connected to any bluetooth device as it may be playing sound thru that device. Could it be because of a restriction needing a click event?

    <h3>No matter the music stops playing or itunes music videos are not playing, using a reliable tool like tenorshare tunescare will be the sanest decision.</h3>
    <p>Around 11pm, it finally worked on my ipad after login/signing on and off for a few hours, today it shows everything fine, but don&#039;t play anything. Is it a problem of the music, or iphone component? Just keep continuous to clear your issue apple music not playing songs on cellular data on iphone se, iphone 6s / 6 plus or earlier models. It is actually very easy to accidently a lot of games offer the ability to disable music and sound effects so players can listen to music while playing or play in public places without headphones.</p>
