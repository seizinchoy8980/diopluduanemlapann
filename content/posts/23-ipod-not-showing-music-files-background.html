    <p>The playlists and the music files with tag informations &amp; album covers will be transfered to your ipoad at the same time, you don&#039;t worry worry about losing anything. The ipod is showing all these music files that had been transferred from winamp, but no music at all on the ipod when i try to listen to a song on it. That means there&#039;s no easy way to add new music, import photos, or make a backup. I just updated to itunes 7.4.2 and now my ipod will not display my playlists/music.</p>
