                Google play music is a streaming app and music player that features over 35 million songs, which is impressive compared to a lot of other music streaming apps out there. Issues with sd card not displaying or not recognized on your android device? Here is a quick and easy solution to detect your sd card on android if you have been facing the sd card not detected problem on your android device, here&#039;s a simplified guide with solutions to all your sd card woes.
    </p>

    <h3>Wait for windows 7 to detect the card as a mass storage device and assign a drive to it.</h3>
    <p>The phone can easily read the microsd card and can detect that there are music files stored in the card. After upgrading android studio to 2.3, i&#039;m no longer able to access the supplied sdcard in android making testing impossible for me. However, the music app does not detect these i don&#039;t speak english edited with google translate. I think he&#039;s saying when he makes his music offline can it be stored on the sd card instead of internal?</p>
