                I don&#039;t need that message occupying screen real estate! If not, you haven&#039;t actually downloaded it to your device if you find that the data is truly there, and it&#039;s not showing up, i&#039;d run a diagnostic, and post the are you talking about purchased music stored on your iphone, or offline content that you haven&#039;t bought? When i purchase music on my iphone, than go back into apple music.
